## 2018

My journey started back in 2018 within my current role as a web developer II. Going through-out my day developing client websites I recieved an internal case for a vulnerability that was brought to my departments attention. Our company uses the DNN platform for client websites. DNN has many modules/widget for clients to use. There was a specific module for contact forms that was vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS). No one on my team knew what it was or what to do with it. I took it upon myself to research and understand what exactly it was and what damage could be caused. Within my research I found that my department would need to black list common chars that is often used for xss and sqli. That is where it all started. One little case. 

From there I decided to get the Comptias Security plus certification. Within my studies for the certification I learned many things and what stood out the most was the hacking. As I continued my studies the hacking stayed on my mind, but I needed to push it to the back. After a few weeks I was Security Plus certified. 

I took a break from study for a few weeks maybe even months to just focus on my current role, but the hacking still held onto a part of my brain. One day after about a year and a half as much of a cliche as it seems I stumbled across Mr Robot (yes I know, sigh). Watching made me excited and i wanted to see if there were actuall jobs that did what Elliot did. There was!

I searched a few job postings, reddit, and other sites to see what it took to get into Offensive Penetration Testing. Enter the OSCP.

## 2019

My real journey starts here. This is where the passion, focus, and motivation came from. In my research of Offensive Security's OSCP I learned that I needed to know more about linux command line. Even more research brought me to OvertheWire.org. I played with OverTHeWire for a bit and completed Bandit. After bandit I went to a site I found called Hack The Box (HTB). I could not get the access code to even sign up for an account, so i took a step back and found another site called Hack This Site. This site was fun but I wanted more. I found a walkthrough for HTB and was able to create an account, finally. I did a few boxes with walk throughs and enjoyed the puzzles of it all.

## OSCP
In hindsight I have to admit that I signed up for the OSCP prematurely. I signed up and recieved my start date for the pwk while I was out camping with family. I remmeber sitting in a tent and looking over the lake as I recieved the notification email. It was time to TRY HARDER. Little did I know how hard and what I was getting myself into.

## Start of the PWK Labs
The day was here and I downloaded all the resources to get started
